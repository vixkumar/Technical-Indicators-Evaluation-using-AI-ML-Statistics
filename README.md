In this project, I evaluated the performance of technical-indicator-based trading strategies using a combination of AI/ML and statistical analysis. I first analyzed stock price charts using an AIML model to identify patterns and generate buy/sell signal arrays. These signals were then used to simulate trades and compute profits for each entry–exit pair. To understand how different features influence returns, I applied linear regression on the generated signal and profit arrays. Finally, I performed t-tests to statistically evaluate whether the strategy’s returns were significantly different from zero or from baseline strategies. This pipeline allowed me to quantitatively assess the effectiveness, significance, and reliability of the trading signals produced by the indicators and the AIML model.
